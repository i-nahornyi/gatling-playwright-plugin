A simple Gatling plugin for UI performance testing using Playwright.

_`Created with love for Gatling adepts`_

## Example Simulations

Explore the example simulations written in Java and Scala to see how to use this plugin:

- [Java Simulation](src/test/java/ui/performance/simulations/BrowserSimulationsJava.java)
- [Scala Simulation](src/test/scala/ui/performance/simulations/BrowserSimulationsScala.scala)

## TODO List

Here's the current progress and planned features for the plugin:

- [x] Java API
- [x] Support for Gatling EL in URL,names and script blocks.
- [ ] Support for additional browsers (Firefox, Edge, etc.)

- [ ] Video recording and screenshots
- [ ] JS performance measurement polyfill helper
- [ ] Extended reports with custom metrics (TTFB, LCP, etc.)
- [ ] Wrapper for UI simulations (abstract class or interface)
- [ ] Create test cases with examples
- [ ] Docker image for simplified usage
